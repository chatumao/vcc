Virtual Chess Clock - A simple and free chess clock software
------------------------------------------------------------

About
-----
Virtual Chess Clock is a chess clock software, which means that it is a program
that could replace a real chess clock. The first version of VCC was developed
in August 2010 during a real chess tournament, because I and friends of mine
were lacking of such a stuff, so we could not blitz, so we were in bad trouble !


Features
--------
 - two active key areas on the keyboard (left and right) to pull the clock
 - support for exotic time control modes such as Fischer, Bronstein, hourglass
 - time resolution of 1 millisecond
 - inactivation of the window keys on Windows

Ideas, questions, wishes and bug reports
----------------------------------------
If you notice a bug, please feel free to send me a mail to report it: it helps
me to improve Virtual Chess Clock. Please mention details about your OS (name,
32 or 64 bits, aso...) and the context in which the bug occurs in your bug
report. Of course, you can also mail me if you have a question about Virtual
Chess Clock, or if you wish to get a new feature in further versions.


Translation
-----------
If you want to translate Virtual Chess Clock in your native language, it is
possible! Translation can be done quite quickly as VCC is not a big software,
and you don't need to have any special proficiency in programming or software
developping. Please contact me if you are interested.
