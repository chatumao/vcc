Virtual Chess Clock - A simple and free chess clock software
------------------------------------------------------------

About
-----
Virtual Chess Clock is a chess clock software, which means that it is a program
that could replace a real chess clock. The first version of VCC was developed
in August 2010 during a real chess tournament, because I and friends of mine
were lacking of such a stuff, so we could not blitz, so we were in bad trouble !


Features
--------
 - two active area of keys on the keyboard (left and right) to trigger player
   turn shift
 - support for exotic time control modes such as Fischer, Bronstein, hour-glass
 - time resolution of 1 millisecond
 - desactivation of the window keys on Windows
