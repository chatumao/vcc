Virtual Chess Clock - Install instructions
------------------------------------------

Installation from a binary package
----------------------------------
In order to ease the installation of Virtual Chess Clock under some commonly
used operating systems, I provide two kind of binary packages for Virtual Chess
Clock (binary packages for other OS might be available in the future):
	- windows installer for Windows,
	- debian package for Debian based Linux (including Ubuntu, Kubuntu, aso...).

There is no particular needs when Virtual Chess Clock is installed from a
binary package. The runtime libraries for GTKmm are bundled within the windows
installer, and the debian package manager you will ask to install them if
necessary.


Installation from sources
-------------------------
To be able to build Virtual Chess Clock from sources, you need to install
beforehand:
	- CMake (Makefile generation): http://www.cmake.org/
	- GTKmm (graphic library): http://www.gtkmm.org/
	- gettext (translation library): http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
	- Of course, a C++ compiler.

Then, follow those instructions:
	1) Download and unpack the sources into a new directory, let's say for
	   for instance '/somewhere/vcc'
	2) Then, open a console, and type:
		$ cd /somewhere/vcc
		$ cmake . -DINSTALL_TYPE=Compile -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build_type>
		  [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_prefix>] [-G<cmake_generator>]
		$ make
		$ make install

Please notice that you may need to execute 'make install' as root (then this
command becomes 'sudo make install' on Ubuntu for instance). The various options
are:
	- <build_type> : the level of optimization; <build_type> must take one of the
	  following value:
		- Debug => low level of optimization ('-O0 -g' with GCC),
		- RelWithDebInfo => medium level of optimization ('-O2 -g' with GCC)
		- Release => high level of optimization ('-O3 -DNDEBUG' with GCC)
	- <install_prefix> (optional): the path where Virtual Chess Clock will be
	  installed; for instance, <install_prefix> may take one of the following
	  value:
		- /usr/local (Unix)
		- "c:/Program Files/Virtual Chess Clock" (Windows)
	- <cmake_generator> (optional): basically, the compiler that cmake should
	  target; <cmake_generator> may take one of the following value:
		- "Unix Makefiles" (Unix)
		- "MinGW Makefiles" (MinGW compiler on Windows)
