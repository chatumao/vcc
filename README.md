Installation
------------

### Installing from a binary package ###

Depending your operating system, you may consider installing Virtual Chess Clock
using one of the following pre-compiled binary package:

* Windows installer (for Windows),
* Debian package (for Debian-based Linux distributions).

These packages are available for download at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vchessclock/files/.


### Building from the sources ###

To build Virtual Chess Clock from the source, you need:

1. A C++ compiler that support the C++11 standard (typically, GCC or MinGW >= 4.7).
2. The [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) build framework (at least version 2.8.11).
3. The [boost libraries](http://www.boost.org/) (at least version 1.49).
4. The [Qt library](http://qt-project.org/) (at least version 5.0).

When all these required component are ready, you need to download the VCC source
code:

* either by cloning the git repository (from https://github.com/yo35/vcc.git),
* or by downloading and unpacking the ZIP archive with the sources, available
  for download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/vchessclock/files/.

Finally, open a terminal, and type the following commands:

```
cd /path/to/VCC/sources
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

On Windows, using the MinGW compiler, this process becomes:

```
cd x:\path\to\VCC\sources
configure.bat
mingw32-make
mingw32-make install
```

Type `./configure --help` to get more details about the available installation
options.
